# PalCODEX
 Term 1 Project PalCODEX for DV 300

## Description

Our team has decided to draw inspiration from PalWorlds for our web application dedicated to inventory management. In this innovative approach, we aim to utilize natural materials such as gold, diamonds, and wood, which will be stored within a vast storage facility. The concept revolves around allowing users to interact with these materials in a virtual space, akin to the mechanics found in PalWorlds.

The central idea behind our application is to provide users with a platform where they can engage with these natural resources in a meaningful way. Rather than merely keeping track of inventory, our app will facilitate the transportation of materials from the storage facility to specialized craft centers. These craft centers will be tailored to accommodate specific crafting needs, providing users with a diverse array of options for utilizing the materials they possess.

By integrating the concept of material transportation into our inventory management system, we aim to add depth and immersion to the user experience. As users send materials to the craft centers for various crafting purposes, the inventory of these centers will naturally increase. Conversely, the inventory within the main storage facility will decrease, reflecting the dynamic flow of resources within our virtual ecosystem.

This approach not only enhances the functionality of our application but also adds a layer of realism and engagement for the users. By simulating the process of material transportation and crafting, we create a more immersive environment where users can actively participate in the management and utilization of resources. Ultimately, our goal is to provide a seamless and enjoyable experience that combines the practicality of inventory management with the excitement of resource interaction and crafting.
